# Fuzzing API Endpoints

With the help of JS Recon Tool, you can generate a list of endpoints to fuzz. Along with that, it also generates a list of optential hosts that can be used to fuzz the API endpoints.

This is an offline process, however it requires the JS files to be downloaded.

## Tools Required

- [JS Recon](../../docs/installation.md)
- Any web fuzzer
  - GUI
    - Web proxied like [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2025-5-6) or [Caido](https://caido.io/download)
  - CLI
    - [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf)
- An API Client
  - [Postman](https://www.postman.com)
  - [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com)

## Downloading the JS files

The lazyload module can be used to download all the lazy loaded, i.e. dynamically loaded, JavaScript files.

To do so, you can run the following command. The docs for lazyload module can be referred [here](../../docs/modules/lazyload.md) to understand the command:

```bash
js-recon lazyload -u <url_or_file>
```

Upon running the following command, it will give the following output:

```bash
❯ tree

                    └── cloudflare-static
                        └── email-decode.min.js
```

The output directory contains all the JS files that are extracted from the site. This file can be further passed to other sub-commands for offline analysis, or can be also manually analyzed - which is demonstrated in the next guide.

## Using string module to extract all the endpoints

The next step is to extract all the strings, along with endpoints. The target can be fuzzed right away, however, it is recommended to use the lazyload module to also fetch the subsequent requests. The demonstration and the reason for the same can be found [here](../../docs/example-scenarios/next-js.md#subseqent-requests)

Once you've downloaded all the JS files, you can run the strings command to extract all the API endpoints

```bash
js-recon strings -d output/<target_domain> -e
```

:::info
The `strings` module iterates through all the JS files in the specified directory, and extracts all the strings. Since `-e` flag is enabled, it will then iterate through all the strings found, and match it against the known patterns of a URLs and paths, and generates the `extracted_urls.json` file (unless changed by passing the flag)
:::

The following is the structure of the `extracted_urls.json`:

```json
{
  "urls": [
    "https://api.example.com",
    "https://rum.example.com",
    "https://www.example.com",
    "https://app.example.com",
    "https://internal.app.com"
  ],
  "paths": [
    "/v1/admin",
    "/v1/dashboard",
    "/v1/members",
    "/v1/report",
    "/v1/settings",
    "/v1/edit"
  ]
}
```

To permutate the URLs and the paths found, you add the `-p` flag in the previous command:

```bash
js-recon strings -d output/<target_domain> -e
```

This will generate a new text file called `extracted_urls.txt`, which contains the full URLs. Following is a hypothetical example of the same:

```
https://app.example.com/app/v1/admin/something0
https://app.example.com/app/v1/admin/something1
https://app.example.com/app/v1/admin/something2
https://app.example.com/app/v1/admin/something3
https://app.example.com/app/v1/admin/something4
https://app.example.com/app/v1/admin/something5
https://app.example.com/app/v1/admin/something6
https://app.example.com/app/v1/admin/something7
https://app.example.com/app/v1/admin/something8
https://app.example.com/app/v1/admin/something9
```

A lot of this would be `404 Not Found`, however it will also contain the valid endpoints.

The endpoints in the generated text file could be either client-side or server-side endpoint

:::info
Client-Side Endpoints: These are rendered on the user's browser. Often, the server returns the same response these endpoints, and whether the endpoint is valid or not is determined when rendered on browsers
:::

:::info
Server-Side Endpoints: These are the endpoint for which the server is expected to perform an action, which is often an API for the service. The content type for this endpoint is often JSON (which is popular in the REST API context)
:::

## Fuzzing

### Using `ffuf`

The API endpoints are the most intersting when analyzing the requests of an app. These perform some action, and often, when the server doesn't uses server-side rendering, all the possible endpoints for the app could be potentially found in the files the [`lazyload`](../../docs/modules/lazyload.md) downloaded.

You can weaponize this feature of the application. To do so, you can use tools like [`ffuf`](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) or any other fuzzer that you use.

The absolute URLs generated by this module are stored in the `extracted_urls.txt` file. We can directly feed this in ffuf with the following command:

```bash
ffuf -u FUZZ -w extracted_urls.txt
```

This will print everything, including garbage. To filter down the results, you can filter based on the status code, which is the first thing that you would like to do. For this, you can use the `-fc` (filter code) flag in ffuf and filter the `404 Not Found URLs`:

```bash
ffuf -u FUZZ -w extracted_urls.txt -fc 404
```

Since we are fuzzing for API, you would also like to filter based on the content type for JSON. Since an option for this isn't directly available in ffuf, you can use the proxy of your choice.

Since I use, Caido, here's a filter for the same

```
resp.raw.cont:"Content-Type: application/json"
```

![Filtering JSON content type in Caido](/img/guides/next_js/fuzzing_endpoints/caido-filter.png)

Even though the above image is heavily redacted, it gives an overview of the filter.

## Using an API client

You can also create an API collection for the `paths` found, and then use the 'Run API Collection' feature of the API client to fuzz the endpoint. This could be a more convinient method of fuzzing if your primary target are APIs

To do so, you can run the following command:
```bash
js-recon strings -d <output_dir> -e --openapi
```

This will generate a new file `extracted_urls-openapi.json`, which is the standard OpenAPI v3 collection. This mean that this can be used with most of the API clients. Since my preferred API client is Bruno, here's a screenshot for a hypothetical application:

![extracted_urls-openapi.json imported in API client Bruno](/img/guides/next_js/fuzzing_endpoints/bruno-collection.png)

In the above example, you can observe that the collection contains several endpoints, some of which appears to be API paths, and other seems to be a client-side path.

This route could be noisy, but could land you at quick bugs without having to deep-dive into all the JS files.
