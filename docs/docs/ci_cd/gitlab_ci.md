# GitLab CI Component

Run JS Recon against any URL directly from a GitLab CI/CD pipeline. Surface exposed endpoints, client-side vulnerabilities, and leaked source maps automatically on every push or merge request.

## Quick start

```yaml
stages:
  - test

include:
  - component: gitlab.com/shriyanss/js-recon-gitlab-ci/js-recon@1.0.0
    inputs:
      url: "https://your-target.com"
```

## Scanning a localhost app

If the target runs on `localhost`, provide a command to start it. The component waits until the URL responds before scanning.

```yaml
stages:
  - test

include:
  - component: gitlab.com/shriyanss/js-recon-gitlab-ci/js-recon@1.0.0
    inputs:
      url: "http://localhost:3000"
      start_cmd: "npm start"
      working_directory: "."
```

The app files must be present in the job's working directory (use `artifacts` or `cache` from a previous job to place them there).

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `url` | Yes | — | URL to scan (external or `http://localhost:PORT`) |
| `start_cmd` | No | `""` | Shell command to start the app for localhost scanning |
| `working_directory` | No | `.` | Working directory for `start_cmd` |
| `version` | No | `latest` | JS Recon version (`latest`, `alpha`, `1.3.1-beta.1`, …) |
| `break_on_map_files` | No | `true` | Fail if `.map` source map files are detected in the output |
| `break_on_vulnerabilities` | No | `true` | Fail if findings at or above the threshold are detected |
| `vulnerability_severity` | No | `high` | Minimum severity to fail on: `low`, `medium`, or `high` |
| `output_dir` | No | `js-recon-output` | Directory to save output files |
| `stage` | No | `test` | Pipeline stage to run in (must be declared in `stages`) |

## Outputs (dotenv artifact)

The component writes the following variables to a dotenv artifact. Downstream jobs that declare `needs: [js-recon]` with `artifacts: true` can read them:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `JSR_OUTPUT_PATH` | Absolute path to the output directory |
| `JSR_MAP_FILES_FOUND` | `true` if `.map` files were detected, `false` otherwise |
| `JSR_VULN_COUNT` | Number of findings at or above the configured severity |

## Output files

JS Recon writes the following files inside `<output_dir>/<host>/`:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `analyze.json` | All vulnerability findings |
| `mapped.json` | Parsed bundle structure |
| `mapped-openapi.json` | Extracted HTTP endpoints (OpenAPI format) |
| `endpoints.json` | Client-side routes |
| `report.html` | Full HTML report |
| `js-recon.db` | SQLite database of all findings |

All files are uploaded as a job artifact and are available for download from the GitLab UI.

## Break conditions

### Source maps

By default, the job fails if `.map` source map files are publicly accessible:

```yaml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/shriyanss/js-recon-gitlab-ci/js-recon@1.0.0
    inputs:
      url: "https://target.com"
      break_on_map_files: "true" # default
```

To disable, set `break_on_map_files: "false"`.

### Vulnerabilities

Control which severity level triggers a failure:

```yaml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/shriyanss/js-recon-gitlab-ci/js-recon@1.0.0
    inputs:
      url: "https://target.com"
      break_on_vulnerabilities: "true"
      vulnerability_severity: "medium" # fail on medium or high
```

Available: `low`, `medium`, `high` (default: `high`).

## Reading output in a downstream job

```yaml
stages:
  - test
  - report

include:
  - component: gitlab.com/shriyanss/js-recon-gitlab-ci/js-recon@1.0.0
    inputs:
      url: "https://target.com"

publish-report:
  stage: report
  needs:
    - job: js-recon
      artifacts: true
  script:
    - echo "Output at $JSR_OUTPUT_PATH"
    - echo "Map files: $JSR_MAP_FILES_FOUND"
    - echo "Vulnerabilities: $JSR_VULN_COUNT"
```

## Pinning to a specific JS Recon version

```yaml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/shriyanss/js-recon-gitlab-ci/js-recon@1.0.0
    inputs:
      url: "https://target.com"
      version: "1.3.1"
```

Use `alpha` to track the latest pre-release.

## Custom stage

```yaml
stages:
  - security

include:
  - component: gitlab.com/shriyanss/js-recon-gitlab-ci/js-recon@1.0.0
    inputs:
      url: "https://target.com"
      stage: "security"
```
