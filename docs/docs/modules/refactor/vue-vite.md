# Vue.js (Vite) Refactor

The `-t vue-vite` technology refactors Vue 3 + Vite bundle chunks into readable ES module files. It handles the split-chunk output produced by `@vitejs/plugin-vue` with lazy-loaded routes.

## Bundle format

Vue 3 + Vite produces two types of files:

**Main index chunk** (large, ~80–300 kB):
- Contains all of Vue core, vue-router, and shared app utilities
- Exports a small set of Vue runtime functions under minified single-letter aliases:
  ```js
  export { Eu as _, qt as a, Nl as c, Pl as o }
  ```
- Identified by the presence of `__vccOpts` (the SFC component options flag)

**Lazy page chunks** (small, ~0.2–5 kB per route):
- Generated when routes are lazy-loaded: `component: () => import('../views/Home.vue')`
- Import minified Vue functions from the main index:
  ```js
  import { _ as t, c as a, a as o, o as s } from "./index-Dcf91m-J.js"
  ```
- Export the page component as the default export

For vue-vite to produce useful output, your Vue app must use **lazy-loaded routes** to trigger code splitting. Eager routes produce a single bundle with no separate page chunks.

## What vue-vite does

### Step 1 — Analyse the main index chunk

The refactor tool parses the main index chunk and builds a map of export aliases to canonical Vue 3 API names by fingerprinting each function body:

| Export alias | Canonical name    | Fingerprint                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_`          | `_export_sfc`     | body contains `__vccOpts`                               |
| `c`          | `createElementBlock` | wraps createBaseVNode with block tracking flag       |
| `o`          | `openBlock`       | `(e=!1)` param + pushes to block stack array            |
| `a`          | `createBaseVNode` | creates `{__v_isVNode: true, ...}` object               |

The specific aliases vary per build (they depend on which Vue APIs the app uses).

### Step 2 — Rewrite page chunk imports

Each lazy page chunk's index import is rewritten to a canonical `import { ... } from 'vue'` statement:

**Before:**
```js
import { _ as t, c as a, a as o, o as s } from "./index-Dcf91m-J.js";
```

**After:**
```js
import { createElementBlock as a, createBaseVNode as o, openBlock as s } from 'vue';
```

### Step 3 — Inline the `_export_sfc` helper

The `_export_sfc` function is a compiler-internal helper injected by `@vitejs/plugin-vue`. It is not part of Vue's public API, so it cannot be imported from `vue`. Instead, it is inlined as a local constant:

```js
const _export_sfc = (sfc, props) => {
  const target = sfc.__vccOpts || sfc;
  for (const [key, val] of props) target[key] = val;
  return target;
};
const t = _export_sfc; // local alias used in this chunk
```

## Example

**Input** (lazy page chunk, raw):

```js
import{_ as t,c as a,a as o,o as s}from"./index-Dcf91m-J.js";
const c={},n={class:"home"};
function r(l,e){
  return s(),a("div",n,[...e[0]||(e[0]=[o("h1",null,"Home Page",-1),o("p",null,"Welcome.",-1)])])
}
const m=t(c,[["render",r],["__scopeId","data-v-88586f7c"]]);
export{m as default};
```

**Output** (`Home--CqlrOQV.js`):

```js
import { createElementBlock as a, createBaseVNode as o, openBlock as s } from 'vue';

const _export_sfc = (sfc, props) => {
  const target = sfc.__vccOpts || sfc;
  for (const [key, val] of props) target[key] = val;
  return target;
};
const t = _export_sfc;

const c = {},
  n = { class: 'home' };

function r(l, e) {
  return (
    s(),
    a('div', n, [
      ...(e[0] ||
        (e[0] = [
          o('h1', null, 'Home Page', -1),
          o('p', null, 'Welcome.', -1)
        ]))
    ])
  );
}

const m = t(c, [['render', r], ['__scopeId', 'data-v-88586f7c']]);
export { m as default };
```

## Vue render function patterns

Vue 3 compile render functions using these runtime helpers:

| Function              | Purpose                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `openBlock()`         | Starts a new block for tracking dynamic nodes  |
| `createElementBlock()` | Creates a block-level element VNode           |
| `createElementVNode()` | Creates a non-block element VNode            |
| `createBaseVNode()`   | Core VNode factory (internal alias)            |
| `createTextVNode()`   | Creates a text node                            |
| `toDisplayString()`   | Converts a value to its display string         |
| `normalizeClass()`    | Normalizes class binding to a string           |
| `withDirectives()`    | Applies custom directives to a VNode           |
| `resolveComponent()`  | Resolves a component by name at runtime        |

## Usage

```bash
js-recon refactor -m mapped.json -t vue-vite -o output_refactored
```

## Output

One `.js` file per lazy-loaded chunk (page/component), formatted with Prettier. The main index chunk is not included in the output — it is library/runtime code and is only used for alias analysis.

## Requirements

For meaningful output, your Vue app must use lazy-loaded routes:

```js
// router/index.js
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: () => import('../views/Home.vue') },
  { path: '/about', component: () => import('../views/About.vue') },
];
```

Apps with eagerly-loaded routes produce a single monolithic bundle; all code is in the index chunk, which is excluded from refactor output.

## Notes

- The export alias mapping (e.g. `_ → _export_sfc`) is computed from the actual bundle being refactored. Different Vue versions or different sets of Vue APIs will produce different alias mappings — the fingerprinting engine adapts automatically.
- The main index chunk is identified by the presence of `__vccOpts` and its size (>5 kB). If no index chunk is detected, all chunks are processed as standalone modules.
- The `-t vue-webpack` tech handles older Vue 2 / webpack 4 bundles. Use `-t vue-vite` only for Vue 3 + Vite builds.
