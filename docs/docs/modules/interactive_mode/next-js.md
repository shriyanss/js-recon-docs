# Interactive mode for Next.js maps

The interactive mode for Next.js maps provides a terminal-based interface to explore and analyze the functions within your Next.js application. This guide will walk you through the features and commands available in this mode.

## Getting started

To launch the interactive mode, run the following command:

```bash
js-recon map <other options> -i
```

## User interface

The interactive mode interface is composed of three main components:

- **Title Box**: Displays the title "JS Recon Interactive Mode."
- **Output Box**: Shows the output of commands and function information. You can scroll through this box using the arrow keys when it's in focus.
- **Input Box**: This is where you type your commands.
