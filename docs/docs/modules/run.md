# Run command

The `run` command is a powerful feature that automates most of the JavaScript reconnaissance workflow by executing a series of modules in a predefined order. This command is ideal for users who want to perform a basic analysis of a target without running each module individually.

## Workflow

The `run` command executes a series of modules in sequence, but the exact steps depend on the framework detected during the initial lazyload pass. Next.js gets the full multi-pass pipeline described below; React, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Svelte/Astro, and Angular each get a shorter `lazyload → map → analyze → report` pipeline; and any target where none of these frameworks is detected reports a failure instead of running the rest of the pipeline.

### Next.js

1.  **Lazy Load (Initial)**: Downloads the initial set of JavaScript files from the target URL.
1.  **Strings (Initial)**: Extracts strings, URLs, and paths from the downloaded JavaScript files.
1.  **Lazy Load (Subsequent Requests)**: Downloads additional JavaScript files discovered from the extracted URLs and paths.
1.  **Strings (Final)**: Performs another round of string extraction on the newly downloaded files to find more endpoints, secrets, and other valuable information.
1.  **Lazy Load (Re-pass)**: Re-runs subsequent-request crawling with the freshly extracted paths. The first crawl can only use paths that were visible in the initial chunks; dynamic-route paths like `/post/1` are typically only discovered after the first crawl + strings extraction, so this re-pass picks up the chunks for those routes.
1.  **Strings (Re-pass)**: Final strings extraction across all chunks (initial + both crawl passes) so any new endpoints from the freshly fetched code are also indexed.
1.  **Map**: Maps all the functions and their relationships within the JavaScript files to provide a clear overview of the application's structure.
1.  **Endpoints**: Analyzes the JS files and `mapped.json` to identify and list all client-side endpoints.
1.  **Analyze**: Runs the analyze module to check the code against the rules.
1.  **Report**: Generates a report based on the results of the analyze module.
1.  **Refactor** _(optional)_: Detects the bundler via CS-MAST-S signature matching and decompiles the bundle into readable ES modules. See [Refactor integration](#refactor-integration).

### React

1.  **Lazy Load**: Downloads the JavaScript files from the target URL.
1.  **Map**: Maps functions and API calls; `fetch()` calls are resolved with the same taint-flow analysis used for Next.js.
1.  **Analyze**: Runs the analyze module to check the code against the rules.
1.  **Report**: Generates a report based on the results of the analyze module.
1.  **Refactor** _(optional)_: Detects the bundler (webpack or Vite) via CS-MAST-S signature matching and decompiles the bundle. See [Refactor integration](#refactor-integration).

There's no separate strings/subsequent-request pass for React — a single lazyload covers the bundle, and endpoint extraction isn't yet implemented, so `report` receives an empty endpoints list.

### Vue.js

1.  **Lazy Load**: Downloads the JavaScript files from the target URL.
1.  **Map**: Scans the whole download directory for chunks, since Vue builds often spread files across multiple asset hosts, and maps functions and API calls.
1.  **Analyze**: Runs the analyze module to check the code against the rules.
1.  **Report**: Generates a report based on the results of the analyze module. Endpoint extraction isn't implemented for Vue yet, so `report` receives an empty endpoints list.
1.  **Refactor** _(optional)_: Attempts bundler detection (webpack or Vite) via CS-MAST-S signature matching. No signature data is available for Vue yet, so this step is currently skipped with a warning. See [Refactor integration](#refactor-integration).

### Nuxt.js

Nuxt.js is built on Vue.js, so it follows the exact same `lazyload → map → analyze → report` pipeline as Vue.js above (the map and analyze steps run using Vue's chunk-parsing logic). Refactor bundler detection is attempted the same way and is currently skipped for the same reason — no signature data yet.

### Svelte/Astro

1.  **Lazy Load**: Downloads the JavaScript files from the target URL.
1.  **Map**: Decodes Vite production chunks and maps functions and API calls; `fetch()` and Axios calls are resolved with the same taint-flow analysis used for Vue.js.
1.  **Analyze**: Runs the analyze module to check the code against the rules.
1.  **Report**: Generates a report based on the results of the analyze module. Endpoint extraction isn't implemented for Svelte/Astro yet, so `report` receives an empty endpoints list.

There's no refactor step for Svelte/Astro — CS-MAST-S bundler detection doesn't apply to this framework.

### Angular

1.  **Lazy Load**: Downloads the Angular CLI (esbuild) bundle chunks from the target URL.
1.  **Map**: Scans all downloaded chunks and maps functions and API calls; `HttpClient` calls (`.get()`, `.post()`, etc.) and native `fetch()` calls are both resolved.
1.  **Analyze**: Runs the analyze module, including the Angular-specific rule that flags `bypassSecurityTrust*` (DomSanitizer bypass) calls.
1.  **Report**: Generates a report based on the results of the analyze module. Endpoint extraction isn't implemented for Angular yet, so `report` receives an empty endpoints list.

There's no refactor step for Angular — CS-MAST-S bundler detection doesn't apply to this framework.

### Generic / no recognized framework

If lazyload can't detect any of the six supported frameworks above, `run` reports "Technology not detected" instead of running `map`, `endpoints`, `analyze`, `report`, or `refactor`. In single-URL mode `run` prints the error and exits with code `10`; in batch mode it skips that target and continues with the next URL in the list.

## Usage

```bash
js-recon run -u <url/file> [options]
```

### Required arguments

- `-u, --url <url/list/file>`: A single target URL, repeated `-u` flags, a comma-separated list of
  URLs, or a file containing one URL per line:

    ```bash
    js-recon run -u https://one.example.com -u https://two.example.com
    js-recon run -u 'https://one.example.com,https://two.example.com'
    js-recon run -u ./targets.txt
    ```

  Targets may also be configured as a YAML list — see [Configuration](../configuration.md#target-lists-in-yaml).

### Output directory reuse

An existing empty output directory is reused. If it already contains files, js-recon preserves it and
selects the next available sibling (`output-2`, `output-3`, and so on) instead of erroring out or
overwriting. Use `--output-overwrite` only when the contents of a previously created js-recon output
should be replaced; unowned directories are never recursively cleared.

## Ctrl-C / Interrupt handling

Pressing Ctrl-C while `run` is active shows an interactive menu instead of immediately killing the process:

```
[!] Interrupted. What would you like to do?
  1. Skip the current step
  2. Skip the current target and move to the next   (batch mode only)
  3. Exit                                            (or "2. Exit" in single-URL mode)
```

| Choice                             | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 — Skip step**                  | The current pipeline step (lazyload, strings, map, etc.) is abandoned and the next step starts immediately. The skipped step may still finish in the background, but its result is not waited for. |
| **2 — Skip target** _(batch only)_ | Remaining steps for the current target are abandoned and `run` moves to the next URL in the list.                                                                                                  |
| **Last — Exit**                    | The process exits cleanly (`process.exit(0)`).                                                                                                                                                     |

Pressing Ctrl-C a second time during the menu prompt falls through to the OS default (immediate termination).

The menu reliably waits for your choice before the process continues or exits — it no longer races with the browser step that was interrupted.

## Refactor integration

After the report step, `run` automatically attempts to decompile the target's JavaScript bundle using the [`refactor`](./refactor.md) module — no extra flags needed, since the bundler is detected via CS-MAST-S signature matching. See [Refactor — Automatic detection during `run`](./refactor.md#automatic-detection-during-run) for how detection works and the framework-support matrix.

This flag controls the step:

- `--cs-mast-tech-detect-threshold <n>` (default `50`) sets the minimum signature-match count required to trigger refactor; pass `0` to disable it.

Refactored files are written to `refactored/` in the current working directory (single-URL mode) or `<workingDir>/refactored/` alongside `mapped.json` for each target (batch mode). Any existing `refactored/` directory is deleted before writing.

## Global database (batch mode)

When `-u` points to a file of URLs, each domain still gets its own `<output>/<host>/js-recon.db` exactly as before. In addition, `run` now maintains one combined database at the root of the output directory:

```
output/
  domain1.com/js-recon.db
  domain2.com/js-recon.db
  js-recon.db   <- combined database for the whole batch
```

This lets you query findings, endpoints, and mapped chunks across every target in the batch without opening each per-domain database individually.

### Schema

The global database reuses the same four tables as the per-domain database (`mapped`, `mapped_openapi`, `endpoints`, `analysis_findings`), with two differences:

- Every table gains a **`domain`** column — the sanitized host used for that target's output directory (for example `example.com` or `example.com_8443` when a non-default port is in the URL). This doubles as a foreign key back to the corresponding `<output>/<domain>/` directory.
- Primary keys that were only unique within a single domain are widened so rows from different domains never collide or overwrite each other:
    - `mapped` gets a new autoincrement `globalId` primary key (the original per-bundle chunk `id` is kept as a plain column, since chunk IDs reset for every domain and aren't unique across a batch).
    - `mapped_openapi`'s primary key becomes `(domain, path, method)`.
    - `endpoints`'s primary key becomes `(domain, url)`.
    - `analysis_findings` gains an autoincrement `globalId` primary key.

### Behavior

- The global database is created once at the start of a batch run and updated after each target finishes its own `report` step — it accumulates across the whole batch rather than being replaced.
- If a target's pipeline stops before the `report` step (for example, an unsupported framework), that domain has no `js-recon.db` to merge and is skipped with a warning; the rest of the batch continues normally.
- This behavior is automatic in batch mode and requires no extra flags. Single-URL mode (`-u <url>`) is unaffected — there's only one domain, so no global database is created.

## Web stats dashboard

`run` normally reports progress only through console output, which gets noisy fast on a long batch job. Passing `--web-stats-dashboard` starts a small embedded web server alongside the pipeline so you can follow progress from a browser (or script against it) instead of watching the terminal scroll. This is purely additive — console output is unchanged whether the flag is set or not.

```bash
js-recon run -u targets.txt -y --web-stats-dashboard
```

By default the dashboard listens on port `6767`; if that port is taken, it automatically tries the next one (`6767`, `6768`, `6769`, ...) up to 50 attempts, or a specific starting port can be requested with `--web-stats-port`. The chosen URL is printed once at startup:

```
[+] Web stats dashboard running at http://localhost:6767
```

The dashboard shows a live table (updated every 5 seconds over Server-Sent Events) of every target with its status (`queued`/`running`/`completed`/`skipped`/`error`), current pipeline step, and elapsed time. Each row has a **Browse** button that opens a file tree for that target's output directory — click any file to view its contents inline — and, for a queued or running target, a **Skip** button that cancels it and moves on to the next one (the same effect as choosing "skip target" from the Ctrl-C menu, but from the browser instead of the terminal).

The same data is available as a REST API for scripting:

| Endpoint                          | Method | Description                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/targets`                    | GET    | JSON array of every target's current state.                                                          |
| `/api/events`                     | GET    | Server-Sent Events stream of the same array, pushed every 5 seconds.                                 |
| `/api/targets/:host/files`        | GET    | Recursive file tree for that target's output directory.                                              |
| `/api/targets/:host/files/<path>` | GET    | Contents of a specific file (as plain text). Rejects any path outside the target's output directory. |
| `/api/targets/:host/skip`         | POST   | Skips the target (cancels it in-flight if running, or before it starts if queued).                   |

`:host` is the same host-derived directory name (`example.com`, `example.com_8443` for a non-default port, etc.) used for each target's output subdirectory in batch mode.

The dashboard's lifetime is tied to the `run` process — it shuts down automatically when the run finishes or exits, whether the target list completed successfully or not.

## sj (swagger-jacker) integration

Passing `--sj` runs [`sj`](https://github.com/BishopFox/sj) (BishopFox's swagger-jacker) against the mapped OpenAPI spec at the report step, the same way `--trufflehog` runs TruffleHog at the strings steps. Unlike every other step in `run`, `sj` actively probes each endpoint in the spec with live requests, so use it deliberately.

`sj` must be installed separately (`go install github.com/BishopFox/sj@latest`); `--sj-bin <path>` points at a non-default binary, and `--sj-args` passes extra arguments through to `sj automate` (for example auth headers via `-H`, or a target override via `-T`). `sj`'s own output file (`swagger-jacker-results.json`) is the artifact from this step — its findings are not merged into `analyze.json`, the SQLite database, or `report.html`.

## Example

### Test an internal target with a self-signed certificate

Internal apps often sit behind a self-signed or internally issued cert, and `run` executes JS pulled from the target during the map step, so approve that up front instead of getting prompted mid-run:

```bash
js-recon run -u https://internal-app.corp.local -y -k
```

`-y` auto-approves JS execution and `-k` skips TLS verification — the combination that unblocks most internal engagements without any interactive prompts.

### Scan a single URL vs. a list of URLs

Point `-u` at one target for a quick look:

```bash
js-recon run -u https://example.com -y
```

Or point it at a file (one URL per line) to run the same pipeline across every host in scope, one after another:

```bash
js-recon run -u targets.txt -y -t 10
```

### Route traffic through a proxy (AWS API Gateway, SOCKS, HTTP, or Oxylabs)

Send every request `run` makes through a configured proxy — here, AWS API Gateway for IP rotation:

```bash
js-recon run -u https://example.com -y --proxy-config .proxy_config.json
```

Generate `.proxy_config.json` first with `js-recon proxy aws -i` (or `proxy socks`/`proxy http`/`proxy oxylabs` for the other methods) — see [Proxy](./proxy.md) for the full flag reference.

### Only use a proxy when it's actually needed

When feeding `run` a large list of targets from a config file, some may sit behind a WAF that the
configured proxy bypasses, some may have no WAF at all, and some may be behind a WAF the proxy can't
bypass. `--proxy-waf-fallback` runs the same check as `proxy --feasibility` against each target before
processing it, and adjusts behavior automatically:

```bash
js-recon run -u targets.txt -y --proxy-config .proxy_config.json --proxy-waf-fallback
```

- No firewall detected without the proxy: the target is processed directly, without the proxy.
- Firewall detected, and the proxy bypasses it: the target is processed through the proxy (same as
  omitting this flag).
- Firewall detected, and the proxy can't bypass it: the target is skipped in batch mode, or the
  process exits (see [Exit Codes](../exit_codes.md)) in single-URL mode.

Has no effect unless a proxy is already configured via `--proxy-config`.

### Hunt for leaked secrets

Combine the built-in secrets scanner with TruffleHog for a deeper pass over every downloaded JS file, useful when the goal of the engagement is finding leaked API keys or credentials rather than mapping the app:

```bash
js-recon run -u https://example.com -y --secrets --trufflehog
```

`--trufflehog` requires TruffleHog to already be installed; both scanners run at the strings steps, so this recipe only scans for secrets when the target is detected as Next.js. Automatic installation on first use is being explored for a future release.

### Use a custom or organization rule set

Point `analyze` at a rules file or directory outside the built-in catalog, for example an org-maintained set of client-specific checks:

```bash
js-recon run -u https://example.com -y --rules ./org-rules/
```

See [Rules](../rules/README.md) for the schema and [Predefined rules](../rules/predefined-rules.md) for what ships by default.

### Chain interactive-mode commands for scripted analysis

Forward one or more `map` interactive-mode commands non-interactively, useful for scripting a repeatable query against the mapped output instead of dropping into the shell:

```bash
js-recon run -u https://example.com -y -c "esquery * fetch"
```

`-c` is repeatable, and a single value can chain multiple commands with `&&`. `list fetch` (and `list axios`/`list server_actions`) are Next.js-only commands — for Vue, Svelte/Astro, React, and Angular targets use `esquery` instead, as shown here. See the [Interactive mode command reference](./interactive_mode/vue-js.md#commands) for the full cross-framework command set.

### Tune resource limits for a large batch job

On a big list of targets, raise thread count to work through them faster, skip a noisy lazyload method that tends to hang on brute-force discovery, and cap memory/timeout so one bad target doesn't stall or crash the whole run:

```bash
js-recon run -u targets.txt -y -t 20 --exclude-methods next_bruteForceJsFiles --max-heap 4096 --lazyload-timeout 10
```

This runs 20 threads in parallel, skips `next_bruteForceJsFiles` in every lazyload pass, caps the V8 heap at 4096 MB, and forces each lazyload step to give up after 10 minutes instead of the default 30. Use `--list-methods` to see all available lazyload method names before choosing what to exclude.

### Follow a batch job from a browser instead of the terminal

Useful when a batch run is long enough that scrolling console output stops being practical:

```bash
js-recon run -u targets.txt -y --web-stats-dashboard
```

Open the printed URL (default `http://localhost:6767`) to see live status per target, or poll `/api/targets` from a script. See [Web stats dashboard](#web-stats-dashboard) for the full API reference.
