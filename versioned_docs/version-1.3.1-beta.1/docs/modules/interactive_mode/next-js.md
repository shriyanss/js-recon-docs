# Interactive mode for Next.js maps

The interactive mode for Next.js maps provides a terminal-based interface to explore and analyze the functions within your Next.js application. This guide will walk you through the features and commands available in this mode.

## Getting started

To launch the interactive mode, run the following command:

```bash
js-recon map <other options> -i
```

## User interface

The interactive mode interface is composed of three main components:

- **Title Box**: Displays the title "JS Recon Interactive Mode."
- **Output Box**: Shows the output of commands and function information. You can scroll through this box using the arrow keys when it's in focus.
- **Input Box**: This is where you type your commands.

## Keybindings

The following keybindings are available for navigation and control:

| Key             | Description                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+C` or `q` | Exit the interactive mode (when not in the input box). To exit from the input box, press `Esc` first. |
| `i`             | Focus the input box.                                                                                  |
| `Esc`           | When in the input box, focuses the output box.                                                        |
| `Up Arrow`      | In the input box, navigate to the previous command.                                                   |
| `Down Arrow`    | In the input box, navigate to the next command.                                                       |
| `Up Arrow`      | In the output box, scroll up.                                                                         |
| `Down Arrow`    | In the output box, scroll down.                                                                       |

### Line editing in the input box

The input box supports standard line-editor controls so you can correct typos or paste a long snippet without retyping:

| Key                        | Action                                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `Left` / `Right`           | Move cursor one character              |
| `Ctrl+Left` / `Ctrl+Right` | Move cursor one word                   |
| `Home` / `Ctrl+A`          | Jump to start of line                  |
| `End` / `Ctrl+E`           | Jump to end of line                    |
| `Backspace`                | Delete the character before the cursor |
| `Delete`                   | Delete the character at the cursor     |
| `Ctrl+W`                   | Delete the previous word               |
| `Ctrl+U`                   | Delete from cursor to start of line    |
| `Ctrl+K`                   | Delete from cursor to end of line      |
| Paste (`Cmd+V` / `Ctrl+V`) | Inserts pasted text at the cursor      |

When the value is longer than the visible width, the input scrolls horizontally to keep the cursor in view.

### Copying text from the output box

The output pane no longer captures mouse events, so you can use your terminal's native text selection (click-drag to highlight, then `Cmd+C` / `Ctrl+Shift+C`) to copy chunk code, selectors, etc. Scrolling the output still uses the keyboard bindings above.

## Commands

Here is a list of available commands and their usage:

### `help`

Displays the help menu with a list of all available commands.

### `exit`

Exits the interactive mode.

### `clear`

Clears the content of the output box.

### `list`

Lists different types of information. Usage: `list <option>`

- `list fetch`: Lists all functions that contain `fetch` instances.
- `list axios`: Lists all functions that contain `axios` instances.
- `list all`: Lists all functions found in the application.
- `list desc`: List all functions with non-empty descriptions.
- `list nav`: Lists your function navigation history.
- `list exportnames <option>`: Lists export names for a chunk.
    - `list exportnames <chunkId>`: Lists export names for a specific chunk.
    - `list exportnames all`: Lists export names for all chunks.
    - `list exportnames nonempty`: Lists export names for all chunks that have non-empty export names.

### `go`

Navigates between functions. Usage: `go <option>`

- `go to <functionID>`: Displays the code for a specific function.
- `go back`: Navigates to the previously viewed function.
- `go ahead`: Navigates to the next function in your history.

### `set`

Sets configuration options. Usage: `set <option> <value>`

- `set funcwritefile <filename>`: Update the file location where function code will be written when using the `go to` command.
- `set writeimports [true/false]`: When using the `go *` command, also write all the imports of the function to the file
- `set funcdesc <functionId>`: Set the description of the provided function ID with the provided value
    - Example: `set funcdesc 1234 This function does something fishy`
    - This will set the description to `This function does something fishy`
    - Note that you don't need to provide the quotes for this. The tool detects the description based on spaces(` `)

### `trace`

Traces the imports for a given function. Usage: `trace <functionName>`

### `esquery`

Generates [ESQuery](https://github.com/estools/esquery) selectors from a pasted code snippet — handy when authoring a new AST rule against a real chunk you've already located. Usage:

```
esquery <chunkId|*> <code-snippet>
```

How it works:

1. The snippet is parsed with babel and re-emitted in compact mode (whitespace/comments stripped) — call this the **needle**.
2. Each AST node in the target chunk is also re-emitted in compact mode. Any node whose compact source contains the needle is a candidate.
3. Candidates that strictly contain another candidate are dropped, so the output is the **smallest** matching node — typically the actual call/assignment/expression you pasted.
4. For each surviving candidate the tool prints two selectors:
    - **loose** — type + the most distinguishing key (for example, `CallExpression[callee.name="fetch"]`). Paste this into a rule and broaden/narrow it as needed.
    - **strict** — same selector with the immediate children pinned by type (for example, `[arguments.0.type="TemplateLiteral"]`). Useful for checking whether an existing rule already covers the exact shape.

Pass `*` (or `all`) as the chunk id to scan every chunk in `mapped.json`. This is especially useful on minified production bundles where the chunk id changes between builds.

Examples:

```
esquery 1234 fetch("/api/posts")
esquery * fetch(`/api/docs/${file}`)
esquery * headingRef.value.innerHTML = "..."
```

The same command is available non-interactively via `-c`/`--command` on both `map` and `run`, and can be chained with `&&`:

```bash
js-recon map -d output/<host> -t vue -c "esquery * fetch(\`/api/posts\`) && esquery * v-html"
```
