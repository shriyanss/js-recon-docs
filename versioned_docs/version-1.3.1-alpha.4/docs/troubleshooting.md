# Troubleshooting

## Puppeteer browser not found

```
SES_UNHANDLED_REJECTION: (Error#1)
Error#1: Could not find Chrome (ver. 148.0.7778.97). This can occur if either

1. you did not perform an installation before running the script...
2. your cache path is incorrectly configured (which is: /home/js-recon-ubuntu-gui/.cache/puppeteer).
For (2), check out our guide on configuring puppeteer at https://pptr.dev/guides/configuration.
```

This happens becuase the browser, chrome in this case, is not installed. For this:

- [Download](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and install Chrome for your system
- Run the command from the error

```bash
npx puppeteer browsers install chrome
```

Try running the command again. If it still fails, manually point the environment variable for puppeteer browser to chrome's executable path:

```bash
export PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=$(which google-chrome || which chromium-browser)
```
